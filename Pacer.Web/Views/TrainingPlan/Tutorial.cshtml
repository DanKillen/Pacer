                Training for a long-distance race is not just about clocking in the miles. It's
                necessary to balance various types of workouts, each serving a unique purpose in preparing 
                your body for the rigors of race day.

            <p>
                Understanding the significance of each workout can not only elevate your
                training but also instill a sense of purpose in every stride you take. Whether you're looking to
                increase speed, build endurance, or simply get the most out of your training days, it's essential to
                know the "why" behind each run.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each workout has a pace range that you should aim to stay within. A perfect run would
                begin at the lower end, with your second-half pace being at the higher end. This helps to build a habit
                of finishing strong.

                <h4>Recovery Run</h4>
                <p>Recovery runs are slower-paced and shorter in distance. They're designed to help your muscles
                    recover from more intense workouts. By promoting circulation without causing additional strain,
                    recovery runs can speed up the healing process and help prevent injuries.</p>

            <div class="workout-info jsCalendar-EasyRun" aria-label="Easy Run">
                <h4>Easy Run</h4>
                <p>Easy runs are your standard, moderate-paced runs. They build aerobic capacity, increase endurance,
                    and serve as a foundation for more challenging workouts. They're a staple in most training plans
                    and are crucial for building a solid running base without overtaxing the body.</p>

            <div class="workout-info jsCalendar-LongRun" aria-label="Long Run">
                <h4>Long Run</h4>
                <p>Long runs are essential for building stamina and endurance. These runs are typically longer than your
                    regular runs and are done at a comfortable pace. They help your body adapt to longer distances,
                    improving your cardiovascular system and muscle strength,
                    and are a cornerstone of most training programs.</p>

                    <h4>Race Pace</h4>
                    <p>Race pace workouts are about practicing the pace you aim to achieve on race day. It helps you
                        understand how it feels to run at that specific speed and builds both physical and mental
                        confidence. These runs are shorter than the actual race but are important for
                        building comfort at that pace.</p>

                <h4>Interval Training</h4>
                <p>Interval training involves short bursts of high-intensity running followed by recovery periods. This
                    type of workout improves speed and cardiovascular fitness. By pushing your body into the anaerobic
                    zone for brief moments, you increase your aerobic capacity, helping you run faster over longer
                    distances.</p>

            <div class="workout-info jsCalendar-TempoRun" aria-label="Tempo Run">
                <h4>Tempo Run</h4>
                <p>Tempo runs, also known as lactate threshold runs, help you run faster and longer by improving your
                    body's
                    ability to handle lactic acid buildup This enables you to run faster and longer by
                    increasing your metabolic efficiency and delaying the onset of fatigue.
                    It's a challenging yet manageable pace, aiming to improve both your aerobic capacity and
                    your body's ability to clear lactate, a byproduct of carbohydrate metabolism.

                    <p>VO2 Max workouts aim to improve the maximum rate at which your body can take in and use oxygen during
                        exercise. These are high-intensity workouts that push your body to its limits. Enhancing your VO2
                        Max can lead to improvements in race times and overall running economy.</p>
